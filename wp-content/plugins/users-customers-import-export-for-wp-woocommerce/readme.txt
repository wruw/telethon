== How Does It Work? ==

This WordPress user import export plugin uses CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files as input. You must create a CSV file and enter the user details in a structured format. (refer to this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.webtoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Users_SampleCSV.csv"> sample CSV)</a> This is to match each field of the user import CSV file to the appropriate user fields in WordPress.

For example, the user_email field gets mapped to the User Email. Otherwise, the admin needs to manually map the import user CSV fields.

<blockquote>

Note - For the plugin to work correctly, you must map the headers of all the columns correctly and ensure that all of the fields you enter are in the correct format.

</blockquote>

You can create the CSV from scratch or export the user CSV using the same plugin. Use any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Google Spreadsheets, to create and edit your CSV file. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.webtoffee.com/how-to-save-csv-excel-file-as-utf-8-encoded/"> Save this file in UTF-8 encoding with extension .csv.  </a>

After entering all details about users in a spreadsheet, you can bulk import users to WordPress. With this plugin, you can also export and download user details as a CSV file.
