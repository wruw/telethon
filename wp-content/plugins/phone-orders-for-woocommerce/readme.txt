== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =
Go to Wordpress dashboard, click  Plugins / Add New  , type 'woocommerce phone orders' and hit Enter.
Install and activate plugin, visit WooCommerce > Phone Orders.

= Manual Installation =
[Please, visit the link and follow the instructions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can many operators use same account to add orders?  =
It's not recommended, as WooCommerce remembers customer details and cart contents in active session.
Please, use [free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loggedin/) to prevent this situation.

= How to set default country/state for new customers =
[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/phone-orders-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) has more settings  and we keep adding them.

= I can't add new customer, I see the message "Please enter an account password"  =
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings, select tab "Accounts & Privacy" and mark checkbox "When creating an account, automatically generate an account password".

= I can't add new customer, I see the message "Please enter a valid account username"  =
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings, select tab "Accounts & Privacy" and mark checkbox "When creating an account, automatically generate a username from the customer's email address".

= I don't see Free Shipping [Phone Orders] in popup  =
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings>Shipping  and add shipping method for necessary zones

= I enabled "Cash on delivery", but I don't see it in payment methods =
You should add non-virtual product to the cart at first. If you want to hide this method at frontend - [use this code](https://gist.github.com/alexv66/82d623841d33dc3f6abb1fd98873d710)

= How to pay order?  =
[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/phone-orders-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) allows you to pay as customer, via checkout page.
You can pay directly from admin area too - use [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-mp/). They support Stripe and Authorize.Net.

= How to apply bulk/roles/others discounts?  =
Use our free [discount plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce/) to configure necessary pricing rules.

= My pricing plugin doesn't apply role-based discount =
Please, mark checkbox "Switch customer during cart calculations" at tab Settings.

= Button "Create Order" does nothing  =
Probably, there is a conflict with another plugin. [Please, check javascript errors at first](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis)

= New phone order does not change the stock =
WooCommerce reduces stock only for orders having following statuses -  Completed, Processing, On hold

= Shipping cost is not added to Order Total =
Please, visit >WooCommerce>Settings>Shipping>Shipping Options and turn off "Hide shipping costs until an address is entered"
